Experimenting with different Kafka abstractions in Rust and hopefully landing on friendlier interfaces and semantics for higher-level consumers, consumer-groups & producers.  
Perhaps even an in-memory, fully mockable and inspectable infrastructure for integration tests and beyond? That would be ideal.

Anyway, move along folks.
